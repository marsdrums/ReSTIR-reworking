# The “gi” pass FX

The "gi" pass FX calculates global illumination by gathering light contributions in screen space using ray marching. It also supports material-aware lighting effects and utilizes environment maps for image-based lighting (IBL).

## Algorithm Overview

The "gi" pass computes indirect lighting and IBL using deferred rendering. Direct lighting is handled separately with jit.gl.pbr shading and shadow mapping, and this output is provided to the pass as a source for indirect illumination.

To gather light samples, the algorithm casts rays in screen space. Its primary objective is to compute global illumination while minimizing the number of samples required. This efficiency is achieved through ReSTIR (Reservoir-based Spatio-Temporal Importance Resampling), which reuses significant light paths across space and time. By leveraging ReSTIR, the algorithm reduces sample counts while maintaining a good (albeit biased) approximation of the rendering equation with fast convergence.

Indirect lighting is split into two components: diffuse and specular lighting. Each component processes independently using the ReSTIR framework and is combined later in the algorithm. During each frame, a single light bounce is computed, but the results are fed into subsequent frames, enabling multiple bounces to be calculated progressively over time.

The "gi" pass also considers the BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) of the illuminated surfaces. It integrates with jit.gl.pbr to access surface roughness and metalness values. These surface properties influence the lighting calculations, affecting both the light transport functions and the sampling distributions used for generating rays.
